“scannato” is the name of this dynamic jQuery gallery. It works by generating links to images who's name follow a numeric progression.

For instance, if you find an image at “http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car020.jpg” you can feed scannato with “http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car” for the url field; “1” for the starting n° field; “50” for the ending n° field; “3” for the padding zeroes field and leave “.jpg” as the format. Then, by pressing the “do it” button, a gallery will be generated with all the images ranging from “http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car001.jpg” to “http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car050.jpg”

if the padding zeroes field is left empty, no padding zeroes will be put and the numbers will progress normally.
